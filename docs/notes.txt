lfs (linux from scratch) i am working on this because i wanted to understand how the linux is wokring under the hood..

day-0
So for this, the best resource is the lfs book created by gerarad beekmans

Firstly there was preface and why this book was written.. 
two lfs system was told.. 32 bit and 64 bit

For prerequisites
There were two docs given.. 
- software-building-HOWTO
- Beginner's Guide to installing from source

day-1
lfs follows some standards
- POSIX
- FHS file hierarchy standard
- Linux standard base

Packages which is used to build in the lfs.. why they are important.. learned about that..

errata and security advisories
to check whether package version or instructions in the particular release needed to be changed.. then visit https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/errata/12.2/
similarly for list of security vulnerabilites visit https://www/linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/advisories/


Real work begins now... 

First created version_check.sh
this script checks for the tools needed to compile programs.. 

first created a partition.. i was having ubunutu and windows.. dual booted in my device.. it is recommeded that we should build this on the linux distro..
In linux.. then we have to create a partition.. of 20gb and 2 gb swap.. this is what i created.. due to storage constraint i had..

then created file system i used ext4.. which is the latest version of the ext family.. 
we can use cfdisk or fdisk.. i have used `cfdisk <partition>` - dialogs box opens, select the parition and set the configuration needed.. 

day-2
`mkfs -v -t etx4 /dev/<xxx>` <xxx> is the name of the lfs partition
for creating swap partition
`mkswap /dev/<yyy>`

Setting up $LFS variable.. this is setup to use it throughout the building process.
`export LFS=/mnt/lfs` i have used /mnt/lfs mentioned as in the book

Mounting the new partition
`mkdir -pv $LFS`
`mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<xxx> $LFS`

if we are not building this in one go.. then add the following command in /etc/fstab
`/dev/<xxx> /mnt/lfs etx4 defaults 1 1` - for main parition
`/dev/<xxx> none swap sw 0 1` - for swap file

enabling swap using swapon
`/sbin/swapon -v /dev/<zzz>`

Now installing packages and patches
created sources folder gave required persmission.. to that

installed all the necessary packages and patches.. for that created a file `wget-list` consist of the all the link... for checking that used a md5sums check.. which verifies that all correct packages are installed..

Now creating a unprivileged user.. to create an appropriate build environment..
created /etc, /var and /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/sbin directories.. added symbolic link to these directories using ln cmd

now adding /lib64 also.. 

we will be using cross-compiler which we will install it in new directory.. 
/tools

adding lfs user.. 
created a lfs group.. this is done because if we run a one single cmd wrong as root.. our whole system is in risk.. 
`groupadd lfs` - to view that `cat /etc/group`
`useradd - s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs` 
-s /bin/bash - this makes bash the default shell for user lfs
-g lfs - this option adds user lfs to group lfs
-m - this creates a home directory for lfs
-k /dev/null - this parameter prevents possible copying of files from a skeletion directory.
lfs - name of new user.. 

setting password for lfs
`passwd lfs`
granting lfs full access to all directories under the /mnt/lfs.. using chown cmd

to start a shell running as use lfs.. `su - lfs` '-' instructs su to start login shell as opposed to a non-login shell.. 

day-3
